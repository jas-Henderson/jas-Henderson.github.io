    <p> I have always had a passion for learning new things, challenging myself to broden my skill set to enhance my capabilities and bettering my performance in positions I have held. One area of learning that I find the most interesting has always been about technology! I love learning about different languages, the inner workings of a development team and how different workstreams collaborate to ensure technology projects come to life. That is way I wanted to embark on the journey of becoming a Web Developer. </p>
    <p>My aspiration is to become a developer supporting a company within the HealthTech industry driving positive change within the medical community through innovative technology. I am looking forward to the journey I am on, and excited for the knowledge I will gain through every interaction I have. I believe that my experience with Project Management and web development I can support any team I join in it's success.</p>
